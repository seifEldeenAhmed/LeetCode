# LeetCode Solutions 🧩

Welcome to my **LeetCode** repository! Here, I upload my solutions to various LeetCode problems. This repository is my personal journey to sharpen my coding skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized based on the LeetCode problem numbers and names:

- **`001_two_sum.py`**
- **`002_add_two_numbers.php`**
- **`003_longest_substring_without_repeating_characters.js`**
- *(... and so on)*

Each file is named after the LeetCode problem's number and a brief description for easier reference.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the solutions:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seifEldeenAhmed/leetcode.git
    cd leetcode
    ```

2. **Browse the files** to find the solution you're interested in. Each file is named with a combination of the problem number and a brief title:
    ```bash
    # Example to list all solutions
    ls
    ```

3. **Open the solution file** to view the code in your preferred IDE:
    ```bash
    # Example to open a Python file in VS Code
    code 001_two_sum.py
    ```

## 📜 Solution Formats

I primarily solve problems using the following languages:

- **Python**
- **PHP**
- **JavaScript**

Each solution file includes the problem description and my approach, along with well-commented code to explain the logic.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
